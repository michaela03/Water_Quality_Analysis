# Water Quality Analysis 🚰💧

## Project Overview 🌐
Ensuring access to safe drinking water is vital for health and is considered a fundamental human right. This data science project focuses on the analysis of water quality and potability using a dataset containing various metrics for 3276 different water bodies.

## Dataset 📊
We have provided a dataset (`water_potability.csv`) that includes essential water quality metrics. Let's explore some key parameters:

### 1. pH Value 📉
- pH is crucial for evaluating the acid–base balance of water.
- The investigation shows pH values within the WHO standards (6.52–6.83).

### 2. Hardness 💪
- Hardness, caused by calcium and magnesium salts, influences water quality.
- It is defined by the capacity of water to precipitate soap due to calcium and magnesium content.

### 3. Solids (TDS) 🌊
- Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) impact water taste and appearance.
- High TDS values (>500 mg/l) indicate highly mineralized water, with a maximum limit of 1000 mg/l for drinking.

<!-- Add similar user-friendly descriptions for other parameters -->

## Visualizations 📊
We've included visualizations of key metrics using matplotlib or seaborn. For example, a histogram showing the distribution of pH values.

## Conclusion 📝
This project provides insights into water quality, aligning with global standards. Analyzing these metrics helps ensure access to safe drinking water, addressing health and development issues at various levels. 🌍💙
